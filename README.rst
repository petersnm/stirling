The Stirling Engine
===================

Dependencies:

* Python 3.2
* MongoDB 1.8

Stirling Engine is a game development engine written in Python 3.2  Written as 
a hobby by several geeks, it is intended to run text-based massively-multiplayer 
roleplaying games.  Currently we are in extremely early development, so would 
not recommend anyone who isn't interested in helping bugtest use this product 
at this point.  If you're interested in learning more, check out the /docs 
directory for more information.
