Glossary

A list of all the terms that Stirling uses in a specific way.

.. glossary::

    adjective
        Any :term:`entity` may have a variety of adjectives associated with 
        it, which are used to help distinguished it based on its physical 
        :term:`properties`.  A baker may have the adjectives  ``['fat', 
        'male', 'tall']``.

    clone
        A clone is an instance of an :term:`entity` which is persistently 
        stored and exists in the :term:`multiverse`.

    daemon
        A daemon within the scope of Stirling is similar to a daemon in the 
        \*nix world.  Typically running from the time the server is 
        intitialized, daemons do the global or timed events that the game 
        needs to happen in order to keep working.  
        :class:`stirling.core.daemons.mongodb.MongoDB` is a good example of 
        what a daemon can be.

    domain
        There are four domains to the multiverse: space, time, matter, and 
        energy.

    entity
        In Stirling, an entity is any thing within the game universe which has 
        quantifiable physical :term:`properties`.  Anything from a beam of 
        light to your mother could be represented as an entity within 
        Stirling.  An important thing to note about entities are the fact that 
        they are persistent.  Any property that an entity holds, it will 
        continue to hold, through reboots or crashes.  This is what gives 
        Stirling our unique ability to do such long-term and dynamic things 
        with our universe.

    multiverse
        The collection of entities that make up everything in existence.

    mud
        Short for *Multi-User Dimension*, MUDs are an old-school genre of 
        computer games.  Basically, text-based MMOs.
    nametag
        An :term:`entity` has a list of nametags, which are all the nouns that 
        may be used to refer to the object.  A baker may have the nametags 
        ``['baker','marcus','man','human','entity','thing']``

    NPC
        NPC stands for *non-player character*, and is a catch-all term used to 
        refer to any living entity not controlled by a user.

    persistence
        Within Stirling, persistence refers to the property of entities 
        being stateful.  That means that everything about them is saved, 
        all the time.  So no arbitrary loading of entities; once an entity 
        is brought into the multiverse, it's there to stay. (Until some 
        unfortunateness happens to it, of course.)

    properties
        The physical attributes of an :term:`entity`.

    room
        A room is an entity dedicated toward providing an environment for 
        other entities.

    username
        A username is a unique alphanumeric token which a user uses to identify 
        their account.
