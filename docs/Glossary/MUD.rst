MUD
===

MUD was originally an acronym for Multiple-User Dungeon, though we prefer to use the more recent definition of Multiple-User Dimension.  While almost any multiplayer game could be considered a MUD, it usually implies a text-based roleplaying game, such as Stirling.  For more information, view the `Wikipedia article on MUDs`_
