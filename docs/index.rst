The Stirling Engine
====================================

Stirling is a game engine for building and playing in a simulated universe.  Written for `Python 3.2`_ using `MongoDB 1.8`_, Stirling provides a core set of functions to create a text-based massively-multiplayer role-playing game, as well as extensive modules for building a world for it.

*It is important to mention that Stirling is just a toddler, so many of the things discussed in the documentation are broken, or not written into the code at all.  It will hopefully always be clear what is and isn't currently possible.*

To learn more about Stirling, you should read the documentation outlining some of Stirling's core concepts.
