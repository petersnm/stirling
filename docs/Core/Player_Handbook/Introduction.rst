Player Handbook
===============

This is the main player manual for anyong wanting use the Stirling Engine.  Before jumping into things, a few things must be clarified:

* **This manual treats Stirling as though it were a tabletop RPG.**  This is mostly because I prefer to write it that way.  If you want a more technical explanation of gameplay elements, feel free to read elsewhere in the documentation, though be aware there may be spoilers.  If you actually manage to play it without the aid of a computer, I will applaud you.

* **These rules are still being written.**  There are many missing, and a fair portion of those that are here are unbalanced and untested.

* **Stirling is meant to be fun.** If you dislike an element of gameplay, don't use that module.  If you think something could be done better, you should take a look at the Developer's Manual.
