Introduction to Stirling
========================

Since Stirling isn't much of anything yet, here's a brief history of how we got to here.

In 2004, when Stirling was just a half-thought idea (and not even called Stirling at this point), I tried to write it using an existing library for building :doc:`MUDs </Global/MUD>`, text-based multiplayer RPGs.  After a few months of struggling to make the code behave at all like I wanted, I gave up.  I didn't do anything with Stirling for two years, until a friend pointed out that there was a newer MUD engine being developed.  I tried to use it, and spent about 6 months tinkering around with it, but still, I was trying to make it do things it just wasn't built to do.

Stirling remained an idea on my mind, but there wasn't really any work done to make it a reality.  Real life and lack of motivation to write an entire game engine from scratch were in the way.

Until the spring of 2011, when an excuse to learn some rudimentary Python presented itself.  This was what I had been looking for.  Python was versatile to make the intricate layers of inheritables, easy to read and write, and fast enough to dob some of the crazier things I had wished were possible with LPC.

In early April, I pestered my friend :doc:`Hunter Carroll </Misc/People/Abzde>` to help me get started writing the current version of Stirling.  We went into the project with ambitious hopes for what a MUD can really be.  That's why you rarely see me refer to the game as a MUD in the documentation.  In my opinion, it will be so much more.
