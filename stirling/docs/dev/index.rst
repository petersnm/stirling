Developers Handbook
===================

This is the developer's handbook, your guide to knowing how to make *anything* 
with Stirling.  Go nuts.

Getting Started
---------------

There are a few prerequisites in order to get Stirling working.

* **Linux**.  While Stirling may work on OSX and Windows, we don't support it.
* **Python 3.2**.  Again, Stirling might work with another version, but we 
  won't support it.
* **MongoDB**.  And the appropriate Python module, :py:mod:`pymongo`.
* **Git**.  Not strictly necessary, but it makes interacting with other 
  developers much easier.

Assuming you have these four things, you can get Stirling's code and get 
started learning how to make entities and develop new features.

Our code is stored in our 
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/emsenn/stirling>`_, and can be 
downloaded with the shell command 
``git clone git://github.com/emsenn/stirling.git``.  Once you have the code,
