Stirling's Code
===============

Stirling is written in using Python 3.2 and MongoDB 1.8.  None of the main developers are programmers by trade, so the project has a generally relaxed development atmosphere, with a greater focus on whether or not you have the enthusiasm to live up to the team's high expection of ourselves than technical expertise.

*NOTE*: We are not accepting builders.  When we are, they will be on my MUD, separate from (but using) Stirling.  If you are interested in following our progress to find out when this might be, subscribe to the `mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/stirling-mud>`_.

To learn more about how Stirling works, browse the source documentation.
