Stirling Engine
===============

The Stirling Engine is a multiverse simulator created to run a 
:doc:`textual MMORPG <glossary/mud>`.  Written in Python 3.2 using MongoDB 1.8, 
Stirling aims to provide all the tools necessary to craft intricate simulated 
worlds, where users can create an avatar to interact with the entities around them.

Introduction
------------

If you are a developer interested in learning more about Stirling, you should check out the :doc:`code documentation </code/index>`.  In short, Stirling is an engine for developing and running MMORPGs, but with a radically different approach to, well, most everything.

If you are a player, unfortunately, Stirling is not to the point where there is anything worth playing!  If you want to know more, check out our `mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/stirling-mud>`_.
